## Project Description

Our game will be an ocean themed "choose your own adventure," Oregon-Trail-inspired game. Itâ€™ll function on a turn-based system where a user must make decisions at different checkpoints within the journey. They will be faced with tasks during in-game days, in which resources (coins, food, etc.) must be managed. There will be a save/load and account mechanic. Games could be loaded based on variables stored under a user in a database table. A maritime weather API will allow for a more unpredictable and interesting twist to the game. The game can be educational too. We plan on using a recipe API to generate related recipes to fish (to make it more entertaining) at the end of the game; which is whenever the player makes it to the TBD end wins the game. If the resources are poorly managed, the ship sinks into the ocean and the player loses.
