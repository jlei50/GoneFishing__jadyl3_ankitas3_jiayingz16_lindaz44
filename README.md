## Project Description

Our game will be a "choose your own adventure" kind of game but an ocean edition. We will create a turn-based game where a user is on a voyage to [ ] and they will have an opponent with the same goal as them. They will be faced with obstacles at day-progression, in which they can use their resources(coins, food, etc.) to overcome. On many levels, they will also be faced with a risky choice that could harm their resources and cost them points, or do the opposite. This would allow for a more unpredictable and interesting twist to the game. As we also want the game to be educational, when a player makes a certain choice, or encounters a certain obstacle, a fun fact related to it will pop up. For instance, if they are on the beach and they encounter a lot of plastic trash, a fact would pop up talking about pollution. At the end of the game, whichever player makes it to [ ], they will win the game.
