## Project Description

Our game will be a "choose your own adventure" kind of game but an ocean edition. We will create a turn-based game where a user is on a voyage. They will be faced with tasks during in-game days, in resources(coins, food, etc.) must be managed. There will be a save/load and account mechanic. Games could be loaded based on variables stored under a user in a database table. A maritime weather api will allow for a more unpredictable and interesting twist to the game. The game can be educational too. We plan on using a recipe api to generate related recipies. At the end of the game, whichever player makes it to [ ], they will win the game. If the resources are poorly managed, the ship sinks into the ocean and the player loses.
